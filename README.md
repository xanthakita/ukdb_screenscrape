# ukdb_screenscrape
This script screenscrapes the names and cities from every page of the website https://theukdatabase.net in order to try to get a list of Bad Actors from the UK. This data is captured into a flatfile allowing for later comparison to Supporters of Compassion UK in an attempt to fulfill the requirements of PATCh (Protect All The Children)  which is to remove any Bad Actors from our sponsor pool.
